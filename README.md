# FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM - Mini Project using C 
> To demonstrate circular queue data structure

This Mini Project enables “FOODSTER FOOD DELIVERY”, to manage and maintain its customer’s details and orders for online food delivery. The project consists of four functions which are displayed as choices to the management.

The functions are as follows:
- To take orders
- To deliver orders
- To view next order
- To view pending orders to be delivered 

The *order* function displays the food menu and takes input of the food order and customer details and store them in circular queue. 
The *deliver* function performs the task of delivering the food and thus deletes the order from the circular queue.
As queues are First-In-First-out Data structures. The *view next order* function displays the details of the order which is to be delivered next.
The *view pending order* function displays all the order details stored in the circular queue using the circular queue data structure concept.
